                <p>Wesley K Clements is a 23-year-old gym assistant with an unfortunate habit of bumping off the people around him.
                    He is witty and funny, but can also be very anxious and a bit humble.</p>
                <p>His first victim was his late girlfriend, Heather Fleur Bell, who he killed because she told a joke he didn't particularly appreciate.
                    He has since killed two more people: his brother Connor, and his brother Jeanne.</p>
                <p>He is an American who defines himself as straight.
                    He started studying sports science at college but never finished the course.
                    He has phobias of feet and crocodiles</p>
                <p>Physically, Wesley is in pretty good shape.
                    He is very tall with fair skin, copper hair and brown eyes.
                    He has a scratch on his cheek gained from a tustle with Connor Trinity Clements just before killing him.</p>
                <p>He grew up in a middle class neighbourhood.
                    His father left when he was young, leaving him with his mother, who was an addict. </p>
                
                <p>He is currently single.
                    His most recent romance was with an artist called Madelaine Rory Bailey, who was the same age as him.
                    They broke up because Madelaine wanted somebody more 'badass'.</p>
                <p>Wesley's best friend is a gym assistant called Elsa Driscoll.
                    They get on well most of the time.
                    He also hangs around with Kathryn Harrison and Keiran Davies.
                    They enjoy golf together. </p>
